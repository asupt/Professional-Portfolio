# Professional-Portfolio

## Features:
Basic web structure in HTML, with some structure in place to ease resource access in the future. Needs flexbox implementation for Web app and Gamedev sections (CSS).

## WIP Status:
Took my sweet time getting started w/ mixed priorities, so here's my plan:
I'll whittle at this portfolio here and there while revisiting some concepts such as flexbox and pseudo. While I understand exactly how things work when I read them, I need more time to build a mental map from which I can recall useful techniques.
Also: shifting focus to JavaScript until I complete challenge 3. Implementing a new strategy of small, daily repeated efforts to shift the balance of assignment completion vs information retention a bit more favorably towards the latter.
